# Multi-Resource Network Defense Simulation

This MATLAB project implements an iterative simulation that enables a defender to predict the impact of attacks on a multi-resource network. Resources are contained within nodes and can move between them to minimize risk and mitigate the effects of attacks.

## Features

- **Resource Initialization**: Define resources manually or generate them randomly within specified constraints.
- **Attack Simulation**: Iteratively simulate attacks on nodes and assess their impact.
- **Defensive Strategies**: Calculate defender costs based on resource movement and utilization of backups or mirrors.
- **Risk Minimization**: Position resources within nodes to minimize potential risks.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/multi-resource-network-defense-simulation.git
   cd multi-resource-network-defense-simulation
   ```

2. **Set Up MATLAB Environment**:

   - Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your system. This project was developed and tested with MATLAB R2021a, but it should be compatible with other versions as well.
   - Add the project directory to the MATLAB path:
     ```matlab
     addpath(genpath('path_to_your_project_directory'));
     ```

## Usage

1. **Configure Simulation Parameters**:

   Edit the `Main.m` file to set up your simulation parameters, including the number of nodes, resources, and attack scenarios.

2. **Run the Simulation**:

   Execute the main script to start the simulation:

   ```matlab
   main
   ```

3. **View Results**:

   After the simulation completes, results will be displayed in the MATLAB command window and a plot will be shown which is also saved as a pdf in the same directory of the code.

## Simulation Parameters

- **Resource Set**: Define the set of resources, either manually or by specifying a range for random generation.
- **Number of Nodes**: Set the total number of nodes in the network.
- **Number of Attacks**: Specify how many attacks will be simulated during the run.
- **Resource Criticality**: Assign criticality values to resources, either uniformly or with a specified deviation to represent varying levels of importance.

## Cost Calculation

The defender's cost is composed of two main components:

1. **Resource Movement Cost**: Incurred when moving resources to new nodes if their current node is under attack.
2. **Backup/Redundancy Cost**: Incurred when disabling compromised resources and activating backups or mirrors available in other nodes.

## Algorithm Details

This simulation is based on the algorithm proposed in [Title of the Paper](https://link-to-paper.com). The algorithm focuses on optimizing resource allocation and movement strategies to minimize defender costs in response to attacks on a multi-resource network.
