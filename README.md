# Multi-Resource Network Defense Simulation

This MATLAB project implements an iterative simulation that enables a defender to predict the impact of attacks on a multi-resource network. Resources are contained within nodes and can move between them to minimize risk and mitigate the effects of attacks.

## Features

- **Resource Initialization**: Define resources manually or generate them randomly within specified constraints.
- **Attack Simulation**: Iteratively simulate attacks on nodes and assess their impact.
- **Defensive Strategies**: Calculate defender costs based on resource movement and utilization of backups or mirrors.
- **Risk Minimization**: Position resources within nodes to minimize potential risks.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/multi-resource-network-defense-simulation.git
   cd multi-resource-network-defense-simulation

2. Set Up MATLAB Environment:

Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your system. This project was developed and tested with MATLAB R2024b, but it should be compatible with other versions as well.
Add the project directory to the MATLAB path:
### Running the Simulation
To run the simulation, use the following MATLAB script:

```matlab
addpath(genpath('path_to_your_project_directory'));
```
## Usage

1. Configure Simulation Parameters:

The configuration is set in the Main.m file, including the number of nodes, resources, and attack scenarios.

2. Run the Simulation:

Execute the main script to start the simulation:
```matlab
   Main
```

Main
3. View Results:

After the simulation completes, results will be displayed in the MATLAB command window and a graph plot will be displayed and saved in the main folder.

## Simulation Parameters

- **Resource Set:** Define the set of resources, either manually or by specifying a range for random generation.
- **Number of Nodes:** Set the total number of nodes in the network.
- **Number of Attacks:** Specify how many attacks will be simulated during the run.
- **Resource Criticality:** Assign criticality values to resources, either uniformly or with a specified deviation to represent varying levels of importance.

## Cost Calculation
The defender's cost is composed of two main components:

1. Resource Movement Cost: Incurred when moving resources to new nodes if their current node is under attack.
2. Backup/Redundancy Cost: Incurred when disabling compromised resources and activating backups or mirrors available in other nodes.

## Algorithm Details

This simulation is based on the algorithm proposed in Title of the Paper. The algorithm focuses on optimizing resource allocation and movement strategies to minimize defender costs in response to attacks on a multi-resource network.
